## Introduction

A Hidden Markov Model (HMM) is a statistical model used to describe the evolution of observable events that depend on internal factors, which are not directly observable (hidden states). HMMs are widely used in various fields, such as speech recognition, bioinformatics, and finance.

## Theory

In this section, we provide a brief overview of the theoretical background of HMMs:

- **States**: The hidden states of the model.
- **Observations**: The observed data points.
- **Transition Probabilities**: Probabilities of transitioning from one state to another.
- **Emission Probabilities**: Probabilities of observing a data point given a state.
- **Initial Probabilities**: Probabilities of starting in each state.

## Implementation

The implementation includes the following components:

1. **Initialization**: Setting up initial probabilities, transition probabilities, and emission probabilities.
2. **Forward Algorithm**: Calculating the probability of an observed sequence.
3. **Backward Algorithm**: Calculating the probability of the ending portion of the sequence given the current state.
4. **Viterbi Algorithm**: Finding the most likely sequence of hidden states.
5. **Baum-Welch Algorithm**: Parameter estimation to fit the model to the data.
